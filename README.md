# POS Sequence Tagging

## Project Overview

This project aims to perform Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project is divided into three main milestones, each focusing on different aspects of the POS tagging process, from data preprocessing to building and fine-tuning neural network models.

## Milestone 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Preprocessing

In the first milestone, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing to prepare the dataset for training.

### Data Preprocessing
Tokenization: Splitting text into individual tokens.
Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
Removing Stop Words: Eliminating common words that do not contribute to the model's performance.
Removing Punctuation: Stripping out punctuation marks.
